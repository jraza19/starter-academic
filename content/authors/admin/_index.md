Hi! My name is Javairia Raza and I am a 2021 candidate for the Master's in Data Science program at UBC.  I first became interested in data science through my previous job experiences where I learned about the importance of using data to make evidence-based informed decisions. Through this program, I have applied my skills in data analysis, supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems, statistical modeling and data visualization. I am also interested in the intersection between health and machine learning! I am currently seeking entry level positions and internships related to data science. Please feel free to email me if you have any questions.
